# THE FOLLOWING CODE IS JANKY
'''
What it does is fix an issue with how the dates are recorded, which happens to seperate the times from separate days for the same class. What this code does it maps the classes to a number of time slots, which will then correlate to which days are mapped to it. When the actual writing is done, the time slot is called for the time which maps to a certain class.

If that made no sense,
 Timeslot 1 = Modsim
 Timeslot 2 = Modsim
 Timeslot 3 = new class


When it should be 
 [Times1, Times2] = Modsim
 [Times1] = new class

This code is fixable in the Formatting.py, however it will be functional for all times using this code.
